# Guidelines
Things must be effectively modularized. An a rapidly changing ecosystem it must be easy to stay current fixing components that become dated.

# Core Interaction
1. ### Share Identifying Information
    This information serves the purpose of self advertisement
        license information, picture, instagram, facebook link, license plate etc.


2. ### Agree to Transact. 
Then there is a contract signed by both parties that they are willing to participate in this exchange of labor and currency
    This also needs to be made sure to be safe and verify that it is completed

3. ### Execute Transaction

4. ### Verify Complete Transaction

5. ### Share Qualitative Information
    This infomration serves as 3rd party advertisement, could be necessarily less than 20 characters to limit some things



The above is a minimal design of the core interaction that more can be built upon.
For the first exchange the information passed can have a variety of methods of being created and what sorts of information is given. The information needed for a passenger to feel safe and for a driver to feel safe is market decided. 

Then on top of these standard information practices, protocols can be built to parse and automate custom filtering for what sorts of information is required for an indivdual to agree upon the service.
